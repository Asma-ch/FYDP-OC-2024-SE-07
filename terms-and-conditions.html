          <h5>CHOOSE THE RIGHT SIZE</h5>
          <p>
              That’s easier said than done. Because, what do you do if you are in between two sizes? Well, that’s up to you.
              Do you like a tight fit? Go for the smaller size.
              Loving a loose fit? Go for the larger size.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Top Tip:</strong> If your body measurements for bust and waist result in two different suggested sizes, order the size from your bust measurement.
